This milestone addresses 14 GitHub issues across code quality, UI/UX, features, testing, and documentation. The issues are sorted by priority and dependencies:

1. Bug fixes first (Pydantic deprecations)
2. Refactoring next (cleaner code for features)
3. Features after clean foundation
4. High-risk work (migrations) near end
5. Testing and documentation last (test/document final state)
